# soprano-ui

React components tailored for use in media playing applications

### Usage

1. Make sure you have `react` and `react-dom` installed in your project:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

2. Install this package:

```bash
npm install soprano-ui
```

### Components

Currently this package only exports one component, **MediaSlider**, which is a modified/styled version of the [Radix](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives) Slider component. It accepts three new props:

#### `keyboardFocusOnly`

- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Prevents mouse clicks from focusing the slider when set to `true`. Note that the slider can still be focused using the Tab key and adjusted with the keyboard as usual.

#### `keyboardStepMultiplier`

- **Type**: `number`
- **Default**: `1`
- **Description**: Scales the amount that keyboard interactions will increment/decrement the slider value by. This would be useful for a media 'seek' slider, allowing precision control with a mouse but larger jumps (e.g. 5-10 seconds at a time) with a keyboard.

#### `thumbAlignment`

- **Type**: `"contain" | "center"`
- **Default**: `"contain"`
- **Description**: Determines how the slider 'thumb' position is calculated. If set to `"contain"`, the thumb will stay contained within the slider. If set to `"center"`, the thumb will extend beyond the slider track so that it can stay centered on the current value.
